mission: Deliver Mortimer's "On The Elemental Nature of Gargoyles" to Lex Firestone in Port Wonder.

reward:
- pay: 100gp
- renown: occult_order_of_the_deep_and_forgotten +1

flavor:
- The report is written in High Elvish
- If anyone can read it, they see that it claims an in-depth analysis of living gargoyle flesh reveals it to be magically composed in much the same way as Djinni, which are known to be creatures of Elemental Air. Mortimer therefore theorizes that gargoyles are not beasts, but somehow elemental beings, perhaps earth elementals.
