party arrives in Wonderside, aka Wonder's Asshole

As the sand skiff slides heavily along the seemingly unending, barren expanse of the whispering sands, you begin to see a glimmer of shape on the horizon. At first you think it a mirage, but after some time you can clearly see some structures coming into view. Now you see the glimmering, silvery towers of Port Wonder, and at their base the shining white wall that guards them. And now the pearlescent dome of the Shrine of the Seldarine, a massive temple to the gods of the elves. And finally, once you are sufficiently close, you see your destination like a stain upon the side of the glory of Port Wonder. The Wonderside. A huddled collection of tents, shacks and small adobe huts clinging to the side of the white walls like barnacles on a great whale.
