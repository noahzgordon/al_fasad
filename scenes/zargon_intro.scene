Upon arrival in Sahada, Korvin receives a package from his patron, Zargon the Tormentor. 

The package contains a letter and a small pouch. The letter is written in Infernal and sealed with a dark red wax.

It is delivered by a small, light-skinned orphan in rags. If Korvin tries to talk to the orphan, he smiles back with a mouth full of rows of sharp teeth, and then runs away.

check arcana 15: Korvin can tell that the wax contains his blood, and Zargon will know when he has broken the seal.

check nature 12: Korvin can tell that the letter is written on beautifully-treated human skin.

The letter reads:

"""
Pursuant to your contract with Zargon the Tormentor, Overlord of the Bloodforge and Devourer of Souls ("The Patron"), just compensation for powers granted is hereby called to effect by Korvin Dallas ("The Warlock").

The following conditions are to be met. Failure to meet these conditions will result in punishment as outlined in Section Zrax, Subsection 14, Article 86, Clause of the Fang, Subclause of the Flayed Bull, Paragraph 176 of the Pact.

In addition, the granting of additional powers by the The Patron shall cease until such a time as these conditions are met.

The conditions are as follows:

- Zheffir Stormcaller is accompanied on his journey across the Sea of Sands by The Warlock.
- Zheffir Stormcaller's cargo arrives in Port Wonder and is delivered safely to its intended recipient.
- The *special article* is placed beside the cargo, inside of its receptacle, at least three (3) days prior to arrival.
"""

check arcana 18: Korvin is familiar with the clause in question. He knows that the punishment is to be flayed alive and rolled in salt for two years.
