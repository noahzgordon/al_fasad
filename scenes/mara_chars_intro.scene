Mara Despth, Daughter of Vengeance

---

First, some background. You are a member of House Despth of Menzoberranzon. Your mother was first daughter of the house and a High Priestess of Lolth. When you were just a baby, she was slaughtered by your father, who escaped Lolth's justice to the surface world. The head of your house, Matron Mother Qualnstin Despth, declared you the Daughter of Vengeance and saw to it that you would be raised to avenge your mother's death under the tutelage of your aunt, Qilshalee Despth.

Upon your 35th birthday, it was decided by the Spider Queen and her handmaidens that your time had come, and you were sent to the surface world to seek out your father the traitor Hadril, and bring him to justice.

When you arrive in Sahada, you are immediately approached by a small human boy with stumps at the ends of his arms, who averts his eyes when speaking.

"Mistress Despth, please come with me. The Matron Mother is here and wishes to see you."

---

The boy leads you through the desert oasis to a private area full of spaciously-arranged, lavish tents. Tucked away in an isolated corner is black and gray tent of pure gossamer, emblazoned with silk spiders. Outside it stands a tall woman in a dark robe that obscures her face.

"Sister, you have arrived!"

After some conversation, Qilshalee escorts her sister inside, where the Matron Mother is waiting. The interior of the tent is completely dark except for a single candle and brazier in its center. The Matron Mother sits on a silken throne next to an obsidian chest, and an older male Drow in wizard's robes sits in the corner on a stool.

"Ah, the Daughter of Vengeance arrives! The appointed hour is here at last."

"Remember, young one, how this traitor brough shame upon our House by slaughtering your mother in cold blood. Remember how he brought the disfavor of Lolth upon us. Now at last we may regain the Spider Queen's favor."

She makes her way to the center of the room, where upon a table sits a map of Al-Fasad and a caged spider, as well as the candle and brazier.

She throws skullcap and lavendar into the brazier, and then hands you a beautiful ritual dagger.

[She instructs you to pierce your palm and drop your blood intro the brazier]

The brazier alights and you feel a strong divine presence. Suddenly an illusionary vision superimposes upon and takes the form of the lone candle. The candle seems to quicken its melting and reform constantly, before spreading a sickening mouth and single scarlet eyeball. It grows eight writhing tentacles and begins to speak.

"WHO DARES TO SUMMON DRAR'GOMOTH, HANDMAIDEN OF LOLTH?!"

[Religion 12 - it's a yochlol]

Qualnstin is unperterbed and speaks with poise and confidence.

"Drar'Gomoth, servant of our Dark Queen Lolth, it is I, Matron Mother Qualnstin Despth. The appointed time has come. You taste the blood of the Daughter of Vengeance. Will you guide her on Lolth's quest?"

A silence hangs in the air.

"Young Daughter, come before me, that I may look upon your visage."

The yochlol's form flickers before you, so that you see at once its true form, as well as a creeping tarantula and a female drow child.

"What say you of your quest, Daughter of Vengeance?"

...

"Yes, this will serve. I will aid you on your quest. When you are in need of my council, light a single candle and call upon me."

---

"O Goddess Lolth, we beseech you. Show our daughter her course, that she may honor you with her deeds."

She open the cage's door. The spider emerges and stumbles drunkenly over the map. It stops just slightly to the East of Port Wonder, then abruptly falls over. Its legs twitch erratically, and it dies.

"This is where you must go."

She hands you a pouch containing some kind of square object.

"Be careful with this, for it is fragile. When you meet the traitor in battle, do not kill him. Incapacitate him and take him to your brother Phyxdax, who awaits you in Port Wonder. We have powerful allies in this city. Your brother will introduce you and show you how to make use of this artifact."

...

"One last thing. A gift from the armory of House Despth. May it serve you well."

She opens the obsidian chest next to her throne, takes out an item, and hands it to you.

"Now we must return to Menzoberranzan, young one. Do you have any other questions before you begin your quest?"

She calls out to the man sitting in the corner. "Now Mournimar, take us back." He quickly looks up, stands, and begins to cast a spell. Your sister and mother go to join him. In a moment they vanish and leave you alone in the tent with the flickering candle.
