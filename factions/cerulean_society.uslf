An order of mages and sorcerers serving the blue dragon Syrus. In return he rewards them with magical instruments from his horde and kobold servants.

Their top priority is to retrieve and safeguard two of Syrus's eggs from the deep south of the continent after they were stolen away by a daring band of arcane thieves.
